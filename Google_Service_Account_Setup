## 🔑 Google Service Account Setup

1. Go to **[Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)**.  

2. **Enable the Google Sheets API**  
   - In Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services → Library**  
   - Search for **Google Sheets API**  
   - Click **Google Sheets API → Enable**  

3. **Create a Service Account and download the credentials JSON file**  
   - In Cloud Console, go to **IAM & Admin → Service Accounts**  
   - Click **➕ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**  
     - **Service account name**: e.g. `json-reviewer`  
     - **Service account ID** will be auto-filled  
   - Click **CREATE** (you can skip granting roles here; roles are for broader GCP access — not required just to access a spreadsheet if you share the sheet with the service account)  
   - After creation, click the service account entry → **Keys** tab → **Add Key → Create new key**  
   - Choose **JSON → Create** → a file like `credentials-XXXXX.json` will download  
   - **Save and rename** it to `credentials.json` (or keep the filename and update the path in `config.yaml`)  

4. **Update your project**  
   - Place the `credentials.json` file inside your project folder  
   - Open **`config.yaml`** and update the `credentials_file` path if needed  

5. **Share your Google Sheet with the Service Account**  
   - Open your Google Sheet in the browser  
   - Click **Share** (top-right)  
   - Open the downloaded `credentials.json` in an editor and copy the value of **`client_email`**  
     ```json
     "client_email": "json-reviewer@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
     ```  
   - Paste this email into the Sheet’s share dialog and grant at least **Viewer** access (or **Editor**)
